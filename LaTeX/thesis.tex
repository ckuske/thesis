\begin{quote}

This thesis will give an overview of pairwise matrices and their properties. After this introduction, a summary of existing literature on Pairwise Matrices will follow.  

A method of generating a consistent Pairwise Matrix from an inconsistent matrix will be presented, along with a method to find a consistent matrix that is as close to the original inconsistent matrix as possible using a calculated distance.  After this methodology has been described, an analysis of the results and further work to be done will follow.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Formation of Consistent Matrix}

\subsection{Example}

\subsection{Distance Calculation}
%
%\begin{theorem}\label{T:H}
%    The number of maximum inconsistencies ($Mi$) in a \textit{PRM} (positive reciprocal matrix) is proportional to the size of matrix $M$.  The number of inconsistencies is determined by the following formula:
%    
%    \begin{equation}Mi = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\end{equation}
%\end{theorem}
%
%\begin{proof}
%    There are those who might leave this proof to the reader... to do so would be inappropriate.
%\end{proof}

If $M$ is consistent, any row or column of $M$ may be selected such that:

[$w_1$,$w_2$,...,$w_n$] = [$a_{11}$, $a_{21}$, $a_{31}$, ..., $a_n1$]

By consistency of $M$, it is also true that 
$a_{1n}$ = $a_{1i}$ * $a_{in}$

$a'_{in}$ := $\frac{w_i}{w_n}$

which when further decomposed, the following holds true:

$\frac{w_i}{w_n}$ = $\frac{a_{1i}}{a_{ni}}$ which is in turn is equivalent to $\frac{\frac{a_{1n}}{a_{in}}}{a_{ni}}$

$\frac{a_{1n}}{a_{in}*a{ni}} = 1$

which reduces to simply $a_{1n}$ since $\frac{a_{1n}}{1} = 1$

${a_{in}*a_{ni}}$ is always 1 via the properties of pairwise matrices.

Let $M'$ to be the $M'<W>$ where $\|M-W\|$ is smallest.



%In more than one dimension, the analogue to Hamburger's theorem has a slightly more complicated expression.  The full proof
%may be found in \cite{F}.



\section{Results}

Consider addressing what the next person to work in this area might tackle.
